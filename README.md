# Piracy notice

**This is NOT Piracy!!!!**

You can read about how flskinner, which is responsible for changing the colors of the GUI works [HERE](https://github.com/liquiad/flskinner).
I do not share any DLLs or anything that's Image Line's. For advanced users I have included a few presets files, but that is not piracy. 
**But!** skinning FL studio **is** against their EULA, so use this at your own risk.
## How to Install

## 1)

 1. Download the **skin files** Here
 
 2. Download **FL Skinner** [Here](https://github.com/liquiad/flskinner/releases/latest/download/flskinner_x64_release.zip)

## For big men and women only:
If you open the skin files, you can notice that there are a few more folders, FL Studio, Artwork, NFOs and BACKUP
Those are for you, if you want to get a bit deeper inside of FL customization. This won't change anything too much, so for ordinary users this might seem a bit useless, but if you really want to edit those details, there you go.

## FL Studio
This is for **note colors** and **toolbar layouts**
Open your FL user data (by default it is in `%userprofile%\Documents\Image-Line\` (you can see where that is located here (mine is a bit different):
![User Data Folder](https://i.ibb.co/wcKx5HV/OQf-GMCe-LRW.png)
Copy the **FL Studio** folder from the skin files that you downloaded to there  

## Artwork

This is for the  **fl studio logos**  
Copy the **Artwork** folder. Open your FL installation folder (the one you picked when installing), by default it should be in `C:\Program Files\Image Line\FL Studio N` or `C:\Program Files(x86)\Image Line\FL Studio N` (depends on the version) and paste in the **Artwork** folder

## NFOs
I have also included some NFOs. if you know, you know. If you dont, you dont.
